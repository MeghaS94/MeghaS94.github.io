                    <p> I joined the team in 2017 and worked on feature development(mainly for feathers), bug fixing and supporting the groom artists

                    <p> Built a cloth simulator using both explicit and implicit integration techniques. The code was written in python and run inside a jupyter notebook.
                        This was done as part of my role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UBC.

                    <p> Created a rigged model using mixamo and used the assigned skeleton and influence weights to implement linear blend skinning. The code was written
                        in python. This was a fun project and also led to learning a bit about automatic weight assignment using bounded bi-harmonic weights.

                        I was one of the top 6 finalists.
                    <p>The solver is based on the principles of newtonion physics, with features like splitting and bouncing of the sparks upon hitting the ground, collision 
                        detection with complex objects like the stanford bunny.

                    <p> Created a web application using MEAN stack where geo-coded tweets were used for real-time visualisation of areas where there 
                        was a crowd. The website would ask for the name of a city, it would use the twitter API to fetch geo-coded tweets,
                        we would classify areas with a high density of tweets as a possible crowd, run sentiment analysis on the tweets and identified the topic of interest and the prevailing sentiments in the crowd. 
                    <p> This was built as an aid to the local police to quickly identify areas with violent or angry crowds and take the necessary measures.

                    <p> This was done as part of the scientific computing coursework : Used numerical methods to analyse the dynamics of a newly laid out road. 
                            PCA, Curve fitting, interpolation, differentiation and integration methods were used to calculate the equation
                            of the road, average vehicle speed, optimal waiting time at traffic signals and speed limit of a vehicle on this
                            new road. 
                    <p>The purpose was to help authorities plan the placement of traffic signals, and building of side roads to manage the traffic flow efficiently.
